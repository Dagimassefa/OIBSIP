# Ethiopian Restaurant Website Landing Page

This repository contains the landing page of an Ethiopian restaurant website that I created as an internship project at OASIS. The landing page is designed to provide visitors with an introduction to the restaurant and its offerings.

## How to Use

To view the landing page, simply click on the `index.html` file above or follow the link in the description. This will open the file in your browser, where you can view the layout and design of the page.

## Features

The landing page features a variety of elements designed to showcase the restaurant and its unique offerings, including:

- **Background Image**: A large, eye-catching image of traditional Ethiopian food that serves as the centerpiece of the page.
- **Navigation Bar**: A navigation bar at the top of the page that allows visitors to easily access different sections of the site.
- **Menu Section**: A section that highlights some of the most popular dishes on the menu, along with mouth-watering images of each dish.
- **Contact Us Section**: A section that provides contact information for the restaurant, along with a form that visitors can use to make reservations or ask questions.
